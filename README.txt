**************** This code was done in Ubuntu******************
Requirements:
1. HiveMQ - it is MQTT broker (Downlad: https://www.hivemq.com/downloads/hivemq/)
2. python3
3. Mosquitto library (pip install paho-mqtt)


Step1: Open and run the hivemq broker in the browser 
	    a. Open the hivemq-4.2.2 folder and open bin folder and run the run.bat file as administrator.
	    b. Open browser and type "localhost:8080"
	    c. username- admin
	       password- hivemq

Step2: Open cmd and go to directory where "Project Files" folder is present and run the file "run.sh"
        command:  python3 run.sh
	This will run the brute-force logic of the project
        
	command: python3 run_ml.sh
	This will run the Machine Learning logic of the project


Step3: open output.txt file under folder "Project Files" which will display the log file generated by the Brute force logic approach.
       open log_file_ml.txt file under folder "Project Files" which will display the log file generated by the Machine Learning approach.
